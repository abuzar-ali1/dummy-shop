        <li><strong>Choose Natural Fibers:</strong> Opt for organic cotton, linen, hemp, and Tencel</li>
        <li><strong>Support Ethical Brands:</strong> Research companies' labor practices and environmental policies</li>
        <li><strong>Invest in Quality:</strong> Buy fewer, better-made items that last longer</li>
        <li><strong>Care for Your Clothes:</strong> Proper maintenance extends garment life significantly</li>
        <li><strong>Recycle and Upcycle:</strong> Give old clothes new life through creative repurposing</li>
